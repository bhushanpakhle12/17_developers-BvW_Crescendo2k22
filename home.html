                            <p>This overview of research paper strategies will focus on the type of research paper that
                                uses
                                library resources.</p>
                            <p>The research paper is a popular academic assignment. Forms of it are also used in various
                                professional fields. The research paper gives you the opportunity to think seriously
                                about
                                some issue. Building on the research of others, you have the opportunity to contribute
                                your
                                own research and insights to a particular question of interest to you. It also gives you
                                practice in important academic skills such as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>formulating research questions</li>
                                <li>conducting research</li>
                                <li>managing time</li>
                                <li>organizing information into coherent ideas</li>
                                <li>substantiating arguments with research in the field</li>
                                <li>and presenting insights about the research</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Disciplines vary in their ways of conducting research, in writing research papers, and in
                                the
                                form of the final copy. See the <a

                            <p>Individual instructors may also vary in their expectations of a research paper. It is
                                important that <strong>you read the assignment carefully</strong>. Writing a research
                                paper
                                can be a very messy and fluid process, and the following is only a representation of

                            <h3>Argumentative research paper:</h3>
                            <p>The argumentative research paper consists of an introduction in which the writer clearly
                                introduces the topic and informs his audience exactly which stance he intends to take;
                                this
                                stance is often identified as the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical"
                                    data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0cf511cf-7d90-4fe1-afa4-3e69fd00fcda"
                                    href="/thesis-statements">thesis statement</a>. An important goal of the
                                argumentative
                                research paper is persuasion, which means the topic chosen should be debatable or
                                controversial.</p>
                            <p>The student would support the thesis throughout the paper by means of both primary and
                                secondary sources, with the intent to persuade the audience that the interpretation of
                                the
                                situation is viable.</p>
                            <h3>Analytical research paper:</h3>
                            <p>The analytical research paper often begins with the student asking a question (a.k.a. a
                                research question) on which he has taken no stance. Such a paper is often an exercise in
                                exploration and evaluation.</p>
                            <p>It is not the student's intent to persuade the audience that his ideas are right while
                                those
                                of others are wrong. Instead, his goal is to offer a critical interpretation of primary
                                and
                                secondary sources throughout the paper--sources that should, ultimately, buttress his
                                particular analysis of the topic.</p>
                            <p>It is typically not until the student has begun the writing process that his thesis
                                statement
                                begins to take solid form. In fact, the thesis statement in an analytical paper is often
                                more fluid than the thesis in an argumentative paper. Such is one of the benefits of
                                approaching the topic without a predetermined stance1.</p>
